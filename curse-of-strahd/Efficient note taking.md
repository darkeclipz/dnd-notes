TOWNS: A description of what it's like, what it's known for, and notable people in that town.

PEOPLE: A list of people and what makes them important. Also not a bad idea to mention skills they're good at and where they are located.

QUESTS: A nice way to keep track of the quests you are working on or past quests you've done. Also not a bad idea to take notes on who you did the quest for.

GENERAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION: You put any important information here that doesn't really fit anywhere else but you know it'll matter and may pertain later in the campaign.

MISCELLANEOUS: You put any random information here that may be good to know but won't necessarily pertain to the whole campaign (Ex. you might sketch a random maze you find on a statue you stumbled across in case it may be of importance in the future).
